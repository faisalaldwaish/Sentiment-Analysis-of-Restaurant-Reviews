# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews



## Project Purpose
This project focuses on classifying restaurant reviews by combining a fuzzy matching technique with a dataset of reviews and using Hugging Face's sentiment analysis model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`). The application has two main features:
- **Review Classification**: It compares the user's review with existing reviews in the dataset and uses a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment.
- **Rating Distribution Visualization**: Displays the distribution of ratings from the dataset.

## Main Files
- **`Restaurant_reviews.csv`**: This file contains the restaurant reviews and corresponding ratings.
- **`full_review_sentiment_analysis.py`**: This Python script integrates fuzzy matching and sentiment analysis using Gradio for interactive review classification and plotting rating distribution.
- **`gradio_review_classifier.py`**: This Python file focuses on building a simple Gradio interface for classifying reviews and displaying a plot of rating distribution.
- **`basic_sentiment_analysis.py`**: This Python file demonstrates a basic example of sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face model.

## How Hugging Face's Sentiment Analysis Works
The project utilizes Hugging Faceâ€™s `pipeline` API to perform sentiment analysis. It uses the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model to classify text as either positive or negative.

```python
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model='distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')
```

For example:
```python
result = classifier("The food was great!")
```

This would return a sentiment classification with a confidence score.

## Running the Code

### Requirements
To run the project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do so by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repository-name
    ```
3. Run the Gradio interface:
    ```bash
    python full_review_sentiment_analysis.py
    ```
4. The Gradio interface will open in your browser with two tabs:
    - **Review Classifier**: Classify a restaurant review based on fuzzy matching with the dataset and sentiment analysis.
    - **Rating Distribution**: Displays a plot showing the distribution of ratings in the dataset.

## Expected Output

### Review Classifier
Input a review, and the classifier will return:
- A rating-based classification from the dataset.
- A sentiment analysis result from the Hugging Face model.
  
For example:
```
Positive review based on rating: 5
Model prediction: POSITIVE with confidence: 0.98
Matching Score: 90%
```
